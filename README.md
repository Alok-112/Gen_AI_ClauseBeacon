## 🚀 The Vision

In a world filled with contracts, terms of service, and legal agreements, the average person is often left in the dark. Legal jargon is intimidating, time-consuming to decipher, and fraught with hidden risks. This information asymmetry puts individuals and small businesses at a significant disadvantage.

**ClauseBeacon is our answer.** We believe everyone has the right to understand the documents they sign. Our mission is to democratize legal comprehension by leveraging the power of generative AI, making legal documents accessible, understandable, and manageable for all.
